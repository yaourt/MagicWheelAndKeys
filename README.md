# Magic 🎡Wheel and 🎹Keys
(for Microsoft Office Keyboard - RT9450)

## What is it about ?
This Microsoft Windows 10 application allows to recover the usage of the wheel and the extra-buttons
from an old Microsoft Office Keyboard (also known as RT9450).

## Why this application ?
Microsoft Windows 10 drivers only support this keyboard in a classical way.
All the extra from this keyboard: the wheel, the extra buttons etc are not taken into account.

I own this keyboard, I like it, and I wanted it to have the wheel and the extra keys back !

## Some information
- When started, the application is visible in the Windows tray
